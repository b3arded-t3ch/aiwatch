In the interview, he discusses that his work focuses on solving problems that relate to Exploratory AI workflows by preempting research needs before they block progress and identifying bottlenecks as well as implementing workarounds as quickly as possible. Gibson''s account of working on supercomputing at OpenAI provides valuable insights into the organization''s operations and culture. According to Gibson, OpenAI operates at an unprecedented scale, utilizing billion-dollar supercomputers and encountering technical challenges that push the boundaries of existing hardware capabilities. He mentions that the employees actively work to save days of compute time by relentlessly focusing on performance optimization to enable them match the cutting-edge technology. The work environment is characterized by a mix of coding, problem-solving, and collaboration, with employees having a clear understanding of how their work impacts specific teams and projects. According to him, employees also have the opportunity to tackle unique technical challenges in high-performance computing which significantly contributes to employee motivation.' /* notes */

According to him, "OpenAIâ€™s lobbying effort appears to have been a success: the final draft of the Act approved by E.U. lawmakers did not contain wording present in earlier drafts suggesting that general purpose AI systems should be considered inherently high risk". Meanwhile, the author claims that "in 2022, OpenAI repeatedly argued to European officials that the forthcoming AI Act should not consider its general purpose AI systemsâ€”including GPT-3, the precursor to ChatGPT, and the image generator Dall-E 2â€”to be high risk,"' /* notes */
